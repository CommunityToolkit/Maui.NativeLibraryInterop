# Get started with a new binding

Get started by copying the contents of this template and following the instructions in the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/communitytoolkit/maui/native-library-interop/get-started).

This template provides the boilerplate needed to get started with creating a new binding via Native Library Interop. It is organized by binding and platform, like all the other sample bindings in the repo:
- **android**
    - **NewBinding.Android.Binding** - the .NET API you will use
    - **native** - the Android project with Java/Kotlin code exposing the API you will use
- **macios**
    - **NewBinding.MaciOS.Binding** - the .NET API you will use
    - **native** - the Xcode project with Objective-C code exposing the API you will use
- **sample** - the .NET MAUI app showing the library in use
